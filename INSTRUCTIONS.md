## Upgrade challenge - Micaela Lechmann

Application develop for Upgrade frontend challenge.

### Tecnologies and libraries used

For the development of the project, I used the React framework, along with Typescript, and Jest framework for tests development.

For managing the user state I used Context API, since is a built in feature in React and the state managed was not complex.

I also made components accessible so people with disabilities can also use the system.
